An app that uses Vision to map out hand poses. Users can change color and line width of drawings over a hand.

Please demo by building on device. Previews on Simulator will not work.

In the future, I would like to add the ability to draw in real time with the captured Hand Pose. 

Example for that--using UI Kit unfortunately--I discovered but chose not to incorporate with given time constraints below:
